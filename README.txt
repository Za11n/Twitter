Install using Stylish

I haven't tested it in Chrome since well I don't use it. There are a few bugs with some dropdown menus/pages with separators that I need to fix which should be done in the upcoming week

The two screenshots are taken in FF 20.0.1 with a custom css style which i should be putting out soon too.

It's quite rushed and horrible if you were to look at the actual css but it works for the time being I thought I'd put it out now so I could continue with some other work; I will clean it all up soon!
