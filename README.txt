Install using Stylish

I haven't tested it in Chrome since well I don't use it
It's quite rushed and horrible if you were to look at the actual css but it works for the time being I thought I'd put it out now so I could continue with some other work; I will soon enough clean it all up!
There are a few bugs with some dropdown menus/pages with separators that I need to fix which should be done in the upcoming week
