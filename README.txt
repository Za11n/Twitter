There are still a few things I'd like to fix with some dropdowns and minor elements

Main colours which should make it easier for you to change
Background : #272727
Borders/Minor stuff: #353535
                     #202020
Main Text : #DCDCDC
Other Texts/Links : #B0B0FF
                    #D7B0FF
                    #FEB0FF

If you want to change the nav icons here's an already modified version : http://i.imgur.com/LNe1ERP.png

One more thing this is a really stripped down theme a lot features are hidden but you shouldn't have a problem making them visible if you take a look at the bottom of the style.
